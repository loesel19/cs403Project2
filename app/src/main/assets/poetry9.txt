You appear,
you undress,
you enter the light,
you wake the colors,
you crown the waters,
you begin moving through time like a liqueur,
you finish off the most blinding of shores,
you predict if the world will continue or fall,
you conjure the earth to keep pace with your molten slowness,
you reign in the center of this conflagration
and from the first
to the seventh day
your body an arrogant
                                            palace
where lives
                          the
                                   tremor.
