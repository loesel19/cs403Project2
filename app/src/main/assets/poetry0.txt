The sky told me nothing about myself
The stars told me nothing about myself
Jupiter gave me zero
Except that I am dust
Which is a lot to go on
But not enough to stop the death
Where are we going to live?
I said to my unknown self
When one of us is dead
She did not say
But opened up a curtain
Where her silence lived
And I went behind the curtain
And laid my skeleton down
I lay in silence as she stroked my tired head
And then I heard a roaring crowd
And knew that I had been onstage
And knew that I was good
