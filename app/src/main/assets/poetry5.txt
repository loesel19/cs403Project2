to Giacinto Stiavelli

Three grapes, Giacinto, grow upon these vines:
The first is pleasure, and is clear as air;
the next is sweet amnesia. Drink their wines,
                                      yesâ€”but stop there,
because the third is sleep, in whose dark corner,
keeping a keen-eyed vigil (as you know),
sits grief. And loud is the mute cry the mourner
                                      cried long ago.
