Night rain whispers from outside the window
of this tatami room. It is someone else's country.
Yes, I know. All poets must submit to an unhappy fate
mandated by the Universe, but perhaps I'll write a few lines—
After receiving an envelope filled with tuition money
and sweat and love from my family,
I attended an old professor's lecture
with my college notebook in my arms.
My childhood friends haunt my thoughts.
I lost them one by one.
What is it that I want?
What is it that I am letting myself get low, here alone?
Life is difficult—
and the fact that a poem can be so easily written
is a disgrace.
Tatami room is someone else's country.
Night rain whispers from outside the window.
Lamp's light pushes against the dark, just a little.
I am the final version of myself
waiting for morning to arrive like a new era.
I am my first handshake. A small hand grasped in tears.
